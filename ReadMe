Programming Patterns:

  -Subclass Sandbox:
    This was a pattern I moreso attempted to use than actually properly utilizing. I wanted    the CardHolder class to function as the baseclass and have provided operations be overwritten by the derived classes (DrawDeck, CardColumn, Aceholder), but the only operation that gets overwritten anywhere is the drawToScreen function which DrawDeck changes. I attempted to implement the card holders this way because I believed that each different card holding type in Solitaire has connected concepts, but each functions slightly differently and thus could each be built off of a shared class which allows them freedom to make changes as necessary.
    
  -Game Loop:
    I used Love2D's game loop implementation to handle updating game data and rendering cards. Game Loops are a standard practice of Game Design and implementation, thus leading me to use it.

Postmortem:

The main point of feedback I recieved on the first version of the Solitaire project was that all of the cards in the draw pile should be moveable. To address this my first plan was to add a new variable to the Card class called "inDrawDeck" which is a bool that determines if the card is in or out of the draw deck. Since cards cannot be put back into the draw deck once placed on the board, any time a card is removed from the draw deck this variable can be set to false. Then, in the card function MoveCardFromTo, there is a check that determines if the card is coming from the draw pile, and only allows that card to be moved around. This is done because otherwise if the 2nd or 3rd card from the 3 card draw is pulled, then it would drag the cards under it as a stack and cause cards to be in invalid positions. This turned out to work perfect and allowed me to go from the hard mode solitaire where only the top card is drawable to the easier version in which all 3 are usable.
